ZgeBullet Demo Project #3
=========================

This is a ZGameEditor project file which demonstrates the basic possibilities of the ZgeBullet library to create and use Raycast Vehicle, a simple car simulation.

To drive the car: move mouse (or touch on Android) left/right to steer, put mouse to upper section to move forward, put mouse to lower section to break. Press right mouse button (or double-touch on Android) to reinitialize the scene.

To run the demo on Windows, copy the ZgeBullet DLL to the same directory as this project and/or the generated EXE file.

To run the demo application on Android, activate the menu item "Android: Build APK (debug)" in ZGE. Then, copy the appropriate libZgeBullet.so file to the libs\ermabi\ folder of the generated directory and regenerate the Android application again. Tthe bin\ folder of the generated directory will contain the .apk file which you install on your Android device.
Note: Use the libZGEBullet.so file compatible with your device. In other case, the application can crash. It is recommended to use modern (e.g., ARMv7-A compatible) devices which can achieve much better performance for large amount of objects on a scene. If you have older device, you can, for instance, decrease the number of simulated physical objects to achieve smoother movements.

Have a fun!
