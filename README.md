# ZgeBullet

**ZgeBullet** is a 3D physics library for the [ZGameEditor](http://www.zgameeditor.org) (ZGE).
It is created as a wrapper for the [Bullet Physics Library](http://bulletphysics.org),
an open-source collision detection and rigid body dynamics library. The main purpose is
to adapt the original C++ interface to the type system of ZGE. ZgeBullet can either be compiled
as a Windows DLL or an Android shared library. Physics-aware ZGE projects refer to the ZgeBullet
as an external library.

ZgeBullet is free for commercial use and open source under the [Zlib License](http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib).
