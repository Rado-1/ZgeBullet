ZGEBullet Library - How to Compile
==================================

Note: By <homedir> is meant the directory where the ZGEBullet sources are extracted on your computer.

Before compiling the ZGEBullet, you must copy the Bullet Physics SDK to <homedir>, e.g., <homedir>\bullet-2.80-rev2531\.


Compilation of ZGEBullet to Windows DLL
---------------------------------------

The ZGEBullet DLL is compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 (MSVC).

1. Compile the Bullet library. In the Bullet SDK directory use either one of the MSVC solutions located in the msvc\ directory or use Make. I used msvc\vs2010\0BulletSolution.sln. The resulting .lib files are placed in the lib\ folder of the Bullet's directory.

2. Open <homedir>\vs2010\ZGEBullet.sln or ZGEBullet.vcxproj in MSVC.

3. Build the solution/project with the 'Release' configuration that results in generation of the <homedir>\lib\ZGEBullet.dll file.


Compilation of ZGEBullet to Android Shared Library
--------------------------------------------------

The ZGEBullet shared library (.so) is compiled with Android NDK which must be installed on your computer; see http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/ for details.

1. Open the Cygwin terminal (on Windows) and move to the <homedir>/android/ folder.

2. Run the ndk-build command of the Android NDK. The result is placed to the <homedir>/android/libs/<architecture>/libZGEBullet.so file(s).

By default, the Library is compiled for the ARM architecture (ARMv5TE). To change it or add other target architectures, modify Android.mk and/or Application.mk files. See the Android NDK documentation for details.
